> This project was built as part of the Data-Driven VC Hackathon organized by [Red River West](https://redriverwest.com) & [Bivwak! by BNP Paribas](https://bivwak.bnpparibas/)

We belive agentic behavior will take Venture Capital into the AI era.
To support VCs in their day-to-day work, we created an agentic framework
that provides the basis for agentic behavior in daily operations.

Features:

- automated monitoring of portfolio companies (or targets) in any funnel
- fully integrated into the CRM
- automatic monitoring of the ecosystem
- agentic creation of signals/alerts with proposed course of action

Sources for Signals:

- üßë‚Äçüßë‚Äçüßí‚Äçüßí headcount monitoring via Harmonic
- üìÇ open positions monitoring based on PredictLeads
- üìä reporting analysis based on OpenAI
- ‚öî competitor monitoring based on similarweb
- üí¨ tracking of mentions around the web

## Architecture
This repo is built with layered/onion architecture.
The domain module defines all domain objects.
On top of this we have services.
Services can create signals, i.e. monitor a specific company.
They also react on signals and propose course of action (agents).
Finally, the signals with the agentic actions get pushed back into the CRM.
